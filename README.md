=============

Because Android Support Libraries are so effing damn UX ugly. Thanks to 
Marcin Korniluk 'Zielony' I have a core UX backwards compatible that 
I can extend to get to full Google Material Design parity with back-ported 
new UX features.

Had to clean up Carbon as had some rtl calls  in styles that are 
api 17 only and wrong parent widget style refs in styles.
